## Important PSA: Key Reinstallation Attacks via serious weaknesses in WPA2

Please make sure you update the firmware on your access points, the KRACK vulnerability is a fairly major vulnerability in your wireless security. Ubiquiti has [an article with details on what devices need updates and how to update them](https://help.ubnt.com/hc/en-us/articles/115013737328).
For more details on the attack see the [krack website](https://www.krackattacks.com/).

## Run as non root user

It is suggested you start running this as a non root user. The default right now is to run as root but if you set the environment
variable RUNAS_UID0 to false then the image will run as a special unfi user with the uid/gid 999/999. You should ideally set
your data and logs to owned by the proper gid. The [environment variables section](https://github.com/jacobalberty/unifi-docker/blob/master/README.md#environment-variables)
has more details. At some point in the future this feature may default to on and I personally run all of my own containers with it on. So 
turning it on for your own containers will help prevent any surprises.


## Supported docker hub tags and respective `Dockerfile` links 
| Tag | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [`latest`, `stable`](https://github.com/jacobalberty/unifi-docker/blob/master/Dockerfile) | Tracks UniFi stable version - 5.6.19 as of 2017-10-23 |
| [`oldstable`, `unifi-5.4`](https://github.com/jacobalberty/unifi-docker/blob/oldstable/Dockerfile) | Tracks UniFi Old Stable version - 5.4.19 as of 2017-07-31 |
| [`sc`](https://github.com/jacobalberty/unifi-docker/blob/sc/Dockerfile) | Tracks UniFi "Stable Candidate", The latest stable candidate may flip between the two branches maintained by Ubuiqiti so it is advised you tag off of the version you want directly instead of the `sc` tag. |

### Latest Stable Candidate tags
| Version | Latest Tag |
| --- | --- |
| 5.6.x | [`5.6.19-sc`](https://github.com/jacobalberty/unifi-docker/blob/5.6.19-sc/Dockerfile) |

These tags generally track the UniFi APT repository. We do lead the repository a little when it comes to pushing the latest version. The latest version gets pushed when it moves from `stable candidate` to `stable` instead of waiting for it to hit the repository.

In adition to these tags you may tag specific versions as well, for example `jacobalberty/unifi:5.4.19` will get you unifi 5.4.19 no matter what the current version is.
Stable candidates now exist both under the `sc` tag and for tags with the extension `-sc` ie `jacobalberty/unifi:5.6.18-sc`. It is advised to use the specific versions as the `sc` tag may jump from 5.6.x to 5.5.x then back to 5.6.x as new stable candidates come out.

## Description

This is a containerized version of [Ubiqiti Network](https://www.ubnt.com/)'s Unifi Controller version 5.

The following options may be of use:

- Set the timezone with `TZ`
- Bind mount the `data` and `log` volumes

It is suggested that you include --init to handle process reaping
Example to test with

```bash
mkdir -p unifi/data
mkdir -p unifi/log
docker run --rm --init -p 8080:8080 -p 8443:8443 -p 3478:3478/udp -p 10001:10001/udp -e TZ='Africa/Johannesburg' -v ~/unifi:/unifi --name unifi jacobalberty/unifi:stable
```
## Adopting access points/switches/security gateway
### Layer 3 adoption

The default example requires some l3 adoption method. You have a couple options to adopt.

#### SSH Adoption
The quickest one off method is to ssh into the access point and run the following commands
```
mca-cli
set-inform http://<host_ip>:8080/inform
```
#### Other options

You can see more options on the [UniFi website](https://help.ubnt.com/hc/en-us/articles/204909754-UniFi-Layer-3-methods-for-UAP-adoption-and-management)


### Layer 2 adoption
You can also enable layer 2 adoption through one of two methods.

#### host networking

If you launch the container using host networking \(With the `--net=host` parameter on `docker run`\) Layer 2 adoption works as if the controller is installed on the host.

#### Bridge networking

It is possible to configure the macvlan driver to bridge your container to the host's networking adapter. Specific instructions for this container are not yet available but you can read a write-up for docker at http://collabnix.com/docker-17-06-swarm-mode-now-with-macvlan-support/


## Beta users

There is now a new `beta` branch on github to support easier building of betas. This branch does not exist on the docker hub at all, and must be built from the git repository.
You simply build and pass the build argument `PKGURL` with the url to the .deb file for the appropriate beta you wish to build. I believe
this will keep closest with the letter and spirit of the beta agreement on the unifi forums while still allowing relatively easy access to the betas.
This build method is the method I will be using for my own personal home network to test the betas on so it should remain relatively well tested.


If you would like to submit a new feature for the images the beta branch is probably a good one to apply it against as well.
I will be cleaing up the Dockerfile under beta and gradually pushing out the improvements to the other branches. So any major changes
should apply cleanly against the `beta` branch.

### Building beta using docker build

The command line is pretty simple:

```
docker build -t unifi-beta --build-arg PKGURL=https://dl.ubnt.com/unifi/5.5.24/unifi_sysvinit_all.deb "https://github.com/jacobalberty/unifi-docker.git#beta"
```

Simply replace the url to the debian package with the version you prefer.


### Building beta using docker-compose.yml version 2
This is just as easy when using version 2 of the docker-compose.yml file format.

Under your containers service definition instead of using `image: jacobalberty/unifi` use the following:

```
        build:
         context: https://github.com/jacobalberty/unifi-docker.git#beta
         args:
          PKGURL: https://dl.ubnt.com/unifi/5.5.24/unifi_sysvinit_all.deb
```

Once again, simply change PKGURL to point to the package you would like to use.

## Volumes:

### `/unifi`
This is a single monolithic volume that contains several subdirectories, you can do a single volume for everything
or break up your old volumes into the subdirectories

#### `/unifi/data`
Old: `/var/lib/unifi`

This contains your UniFi configuration data.

#### `/unifi/log`
old: `/var/log/unifi`

This contains UniFi log files

#### `/unifi/cert`
old: `/var/cert/unifi`

To use custom SSL certs, you must map a volume with the certs to /unifi/cert

They should be named: 
```
cert.pem  # The Certificate
privkey.pem # Private key for the cert
chain.pem # full cert chain
```
For letsencrypt certs, we'll autodetect that and add the needed Identrust X3 CA Cert automatically.

#### `/unifi/init.d`

This is an entirely new volume.
You can place scripts you want to launch every time the container starts in here

### `/var/run/unifi`

Run information, in general you will not need to touch this volume. It is there to ensure
UniFi has a place to write its PID files


### Legacy volumes

These are no longer actually volumes, rather they exist for legacy compatibility.
You are urged to move to the new volumes ASAP.

#### `/var/lib/unifi`
New name: `/unifi/data`

#### `/var/log/unifi`
New name: `/unifi/log`

## Environment Variables:

### `BIND_PRIV`

Default: `true`

This is used to enable binding to ports less than 1024 when running the UniFi service
as a restricted user. On some docker filesystem combinations setcap may not work so you would need to set this to false.

### `RUNAS_UID0`

Default: `false`

This is used to determine whether or not the UniFi service runs as a privileged (root) user.

### `UNIFI_UID` and `UNIFI_GID`

Default: `999` for both

These variables set the UID and GID for the user and group the UniFi service runs as when `RUNAS_UID0` is set to false

### `TZ`

TimeZone. (i.e America/Chicago)

### `JVM_MAX_THREAD_STACK_SIZE`

used to set max thread stack size for the JVM

Ex:

```--env JVM_MAX_THREAD_STACK_SIZE=1280k```

as a fix for https://community.ubnt.com/t5/UniFi-Routing-Switching/IMPORTANT-Debian-Ubuntu-users-MUST-READ-Updated-06-21/m-p/1968251#M48264

### External MongoDB environment variables
These variables are used to implement support for an 
[external MongoDB server](https://community.ubnt.com/t5/UniFi-Wireless/External-MongoDB-Server/td-p/1305297) and must all be 
set in order for this feature to work.
Once all are set then the configuration file value for `db.mongo.local` will automatically be set to `false`.

### `DB_URI`

Maps to `db.mongo.uri`.

### `STATDB_URI`

Maps to `statdb.mongo.uri`.

### `DB_NAME`

Maps to `unifi.db.name`.


## Expose:

### 8080/tcp - Device command/control

### 8443/tcp - Web interface + API

### 8843/tcp - HTTPS portal

### 8880/tcp - HTTP portal

### 3478/udp - STUN service

### 6789/tcp - Speed Test (unifi5 only)

### 10001/udp - UBNT Discovery

See [UniFi - Ports Used](https://help.ubnt.com/hc/en-us/articles/218506997-UniFi-Ports-Used)

## Multi-process container

While micro-service patterns try to avoid running multiple processes in a container, the unifi5 container tries to follow the same process execution model intended by the original debian package and it's init script, while trying to avoid needing to run a full init system.

`dumb-init` has now been removed. Instead it is now suggested you include --init in your docker run command line.
If you are using docker-compose you can accomplish the same by making sure you use version 2.2 of the yml format and add `init: true` to your service definition.

`unifi.sh` executes and waits on the jsvc process which orchestrates running the controller as a service. The wrapper script also traps SIGTERM to issue the appropriate stop command to the unifi java `com.ubnt.ace.Launcher` process in the hopes that it helps keep the shutdown graceful.


## Init scripts

You may now place init scripts to be launched during the unifi startup in /usr/local/unifi/init.d to perform any 
actions unique to your unifi setup. An example bash script to set up certificates is in `/usr/unifi/init.d/import.sh`.

## Certificate Support

To use custom SSL certs, you must map a volume with the certs to /unifi/cert

They should be named:
```
cert.pem  # The Certificate
privkey.pem # Private key for the cert
chain.pem # full cert chain
```
For letsencrypt certs, we'll autodetect that and add the needed Identrust X3 CA Cert automatically.


## TODO

This list is empty for now, please [add your suggestions](https://github.com/jacobalberty/unifi-docker/issues).
